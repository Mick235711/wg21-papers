P3351 discussion
Design intent is for it to have same borrowed requirements with transform - yes
bool IsInit default value need to be a declaration, not definition
It is probably necessary because whether there is an init actually affects semantics of class after constructor
The question is whether we want separate types for inclusive scan without and with seed or just template parameter (this is part of ABI)
Maybe we should make the type exposition-only, and alias the type to scan_view and seeded_scan_view to prevent user from writing scan_view<…, true>
See UTF view (utf_view_impl) for example
Iterator should be SCARY; it have no dependency on IsInit (also need to change parent pointer to a base class; if IsInit is false you don’t need to store init in this base class, can also have variation on borrowed)
Maybe consider making it an enum, not bool? Similar to any_view/subrange_kind
Postfix operator++ should return void; forward_range never works

Hui Xie: SCARY iterator is not a good thing! It leads to potential bugs on comparing iterator from different containers, it also loses information

Replace IsInit with enum: 2-3-2-0-0
We want IsInit to be part of exposition-only type, not scan_view type itself: 2-0-2-3-0
Make iterator SCARY: 1-2-3-0-0
Forward to LEWG: 4-3-0-0-0
