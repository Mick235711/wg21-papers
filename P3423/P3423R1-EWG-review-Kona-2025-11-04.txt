P3423 discussion
Next revision target 29
Paper seems unbaked; I want this but I cannot vote yes now
Forward to CWG for C++29: 2-15-9-1-1
SA: I think we should push harder for a full implementation
A: Seems challenging and subtle, need better implementation

TH: Regarding the approval of P3423, just a note that this will require changes to Clang with regard to when it instantiates attributes on functions. Clang currently diagnoses ill-formed attribute sequences on function declarations during overload resolution. Some examples can be seen at https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/8f683c3e4b6fe939a7d0f1167934aa823a889267/clang/test/SemaSYCL/sycl-kernel-entry-point-attr-sfinae.cpp#L30-L65. I (still) think this change is fine though; the current Clang behavior is not (always) desirable.
CJ: Yeah, that part is less clear - hopefully the standard would be consistent with annotations.
CJ: Clang handles attributes in template in a sort of ad-hoc way on a per attribute basis
