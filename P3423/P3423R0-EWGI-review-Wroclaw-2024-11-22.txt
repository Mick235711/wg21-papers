Streamline the presentation, focus on differences from static_assert/P2741
"Make it one-slide change to EWG"
"Make everything work like static_assert"
"Too much detail, just say they work the same"
Only have slides on immediate context, don't make it half-hour presentation

Have you considered whether impl want to pull in <format>?
Focus on when these expressions are parsed/instantiated/evaluated
=> Come opininated to EWG, present your choice directly
=> Probably no way to word otherwise anyway, so probably no options

TODO: Add parsing section
The basic idea is that parsing/instantiating declaration needs to be done on first encountering the attribute/= delete, and also string-like check happens here.
Then, only when the overload resolution selects this candidate, the instantiation of definition is done. Any substitution error is a hard error here.
